# Vault Access Security Feature

## 🔒 Overview
Added an extra security layer to the Secure Vault - users must verify their identity before accessing the vault using either:
- **Password verification** (default)
- **2FA code verification** (if 2FA is enabled)

## 🎯 Security Flow

### Step 1: User Navigates to Vault
When a user tries to access `/vault`:
1. System checks if user is authenticated (JWT token)
2. If authenticated, **Vault Access Modal** appears
3. User cannot see vault contents until verification is complete

### Step 2: Verification Method Selection
- **If 2FA Enabled**: User must enter their 6-digit 2FA code
- **If 2FA Disabled**: User must enter their login password

### Step 3: Backend Verification
API endpoint: `/api/vault/verify-access`
- Validates JWT token from cookies
- Checks if 2FA is enabled for the user
- **For 2FA users**: Verifies TOTP code using Speakeasy
- **For password users**: Compares password hash using bcrypt
- Returns success or error

### Step 4: Access Granted
- On successful verification, vault content is displayed
- User can then proceed with encryption key prompt
- Access remains valid for the session

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. **`app/api/vault/verify-access/route.ts`**
   - POST endpoint for password/2FA verification
   - JWT authentication required
   - Returns `{ verified: true }` on success

2. **`app/components/VaultAccessModal.tsx`**
   - Reusable modal component for vault access verification
   - Adapts UI based on 2FA status
   - Shows appropriate input (password field or 2FA code field)
   - Clean, themed design matching existing UI

### Modified Files
1. **`app/vault/page.tsx`**
   - Added vault access state management:
     - `showAccessModal` - controls modal visibility
     - `vaultAccessVerified` - tracks verification status
     - `requires2FA` - determines verification method
   - Added `handleVerifyAccess()` function
   - Blocks vault content rendering until access is verified
   - Shows loading state during verification

## 🔐 Security Features

### Password Protection
- Uses bcrypt to compare password hash (never plain text)
- Password is sent over HTTPS only
- Server-side validation ensures security

### 2FA Protection
- Uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- 6-digit codes with 2-window tolerance
- No password needed if 2FA is enabled (stronger security)

### Session Management
- Access verification required per session
- JWT token must be valid
- Access modal can be closed (redirects to dashboard)

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback during verification
- Error messages for invalid credentials
- Loading states during API calls
- Cannot bypass the modal (overlay blocks interaction)

## 🎨 UI Components

### VaultAccessModal
```typescript
interface VaultAccessModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;           // Controls modal visibility
  requires2FA: boolean;      // Determines input type
  onVerify: (password?, twoFactorCode?) => Promise<void>; // Verification handler
  onClose: () => void;       // Close handler (redirects to dashboard)
}
```

### Modal Features
- ✅ Gradient icon header (Lock or KeyRound)
- ✅ Adaptive input field (password or 2FA code)
- ✅ Show/hide password toggle
- ✅ 6-digit code validation for 2FA
- ✅ Error message display
- ✅ Loading state during verification
- ✅ Cancel button (redirects to dashboard)
- ✅ Theme-aware (uses CSS variables)
- ✅ Security info tooltip

## 🔄 User Flow

### For Users WITHOUT 2FA:
```
1. Navigate to /vault
2. See "Verify Access" modal
3. Enter login password
4. Click "Verify & Access"
5. [API validates password]
6. Access granted → Show encryption key prompt
7. Enter encryption key
8. Access vault contents
```

### For Users WITH 2FA:
```
1. Navigate to /vault
2. See "Verify Access" modal (2FA mode)
3. Enter 6-digit 2FA code from authenticator app
4. Click "Verify & Access"
5. [API validates 2FA code]
6. Access granted → Show encryption key prompt
7. Enter encryption key
8. Access vault contents
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Why This Matters
1. **Defense in Depth**: Even if someone steals a JWT token (e.g., XSS attack), they still need the password/2FA code
2. **Session Replay Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access using stolen session tokens
3. **Zero Trust**: Always verify, never trust
4. **Sensitive Data Protection**: Vault contains encrypted passwords - extra layer warranted

### What's Protected
- ✅ Vault data access (encrypted items)
- ✅ Password/credential viewing
- ✅ Vault management operations (add/edit/delete)

### What's NOT Changed
- ✅ Existing authentication flow (signin/signup) unchanged
- ✅ Dashboard access unchanged
- ✅ Generator access unchanged
- ✅ Profile page unchanged
- ✅ 2FA enable/disable unchanged
- ✅ Theme system unchanged

## 📝 API Details

### POST `/api/vault/verify-access`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "password": "user_password",      // Required if 2FA disabled
  "twoFactorCode": "123456"         // Required if 2FA enabled
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "message": "Access verified with password" | "Access verified with 2FA",
  "verified": true
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401`: Unauthorized (no token or invalid token)
- `400`: Missing password or 2FA code
- `401`: Invalid password or 2FA code
- `404`: User not found
- `500`: Server error

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Without 2FA:
- [ ] Navigate to /vault - modal appears
- [ ] Enter wrong password - shows error
- [ ] Enter correct password - access granted
- [ ] Click cancel - redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Refresh page - modal appears again (session-based)

### With 2FA Enabled:
- [ ] Navigate to /vault - modal appears (2FA mode)
- [ ] Enter invalid code - shows error
- [ ] Enter valid 6-digit code - access granted
- [ ] Code input only accepts numbers
- [ ] Code input limited to 6 digits
- [ ] Click cancel - redirects to dashboard

### Theme Testing:
- [ ] Light mode - modal has light background
- [ ] Dark mode - modal has dark background
- [ ] Close button hover effects work
- [ ] Submit button disabled when input is empty

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Biometric Authentication**: Add fingerprint/face ID option for mobile
2. **Remember Device**: Trust devices for 30 days
3. **Security Keys**: Support FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware keys
4. **Audit Log**: Track vault access attempts
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
6. **Session Timeout**: Auto-lock after inactivity
