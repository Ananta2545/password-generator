  - Copy with auto-clear
  - Tags for organization
  - Click URL to open in new tab
- Encryption key prompt on first access
- All data encrypted client-side before sending to server

### **4. Security Features**
- ✅ Client-side AES-256 encryption using crypto-js
- ✅ Server never sees plaintext passwords
- ✅ Clipboard auto-clears after 15 seconds
- ✅ Encryption key stored in memory (not localStorage)
- ✅ All API calls use JWT authentication via cookies

## 🔐 How Encryption Works

```
User creates vault item:
1. User enters plaintext data (title, username, password, etc.)
2. Client encrypts using AES-256 with user's encryption key
3. Encrypted blob sent to server
4. Server stores encrypted blob in MongoDB
5. Server never sees plaintext

User views vault items:
1. Client fetches encrypted blobs from server
2. Client decrypts using user's encryption key
3. Plaintext displayed only in browser
```

**Encryption Key:**
- User sets this once when accessing vault
- Stored in memory during session
- Never sent to server
- Can use account password or separate phrase

## 🚀 Testing Your App

### **1. Test Password Generator**
1. Sign in to your account
2. Go to Dashboard → Click "Generate Password"
3. Adjust length slider and options
4. Click "Generate New" to create passwords
5. Click copy icon - password auto-clears in 15 sec
6. Click "Save to Vault" to store it

### **2. Test Secure Vault**
1. Go to Dashboard → Click "Secure Vault"
2. Enter an encryption key (e.g., your password)
3. Click "+ Add Item"
4. Fill in:
   - Title: "Gmail Account"
   - Username: "john@example.com"
   - Password: (paste generated password)
   - URL: "https://gmail.com"
   - Tags: "email", "work"
5. Click "Save"
6. Try:
   - Searching items
   - Showing/hiding password
   - Copying password (auto-clears)
   - Editing item
   - Deleting item

### **3. Verify Encryption**
1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Find your database → `vaultitems` collection
3. Look at `encryptedData` field
4. Verify it's encrypted gibberish (not plaintext)

## 📱 User Flow

```
1. Sign Up/Sign In
   ↓
2. Dashboard (stats + quick actions)
   ↓
3a. Generate Password → Copy → Save to Vault
   ↓
3b. Access Vault → Enter encryption key → Manage items
   ↓
4. Search/Filter items
   ↓
5. Copy password (auto-clears in 15s)
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Encryption Key**
The encryption key prompt appears when first accessing the vault. For simplicity, we're using the raw input as the key. In production, you should:

```typescript
// In VaultContext.tsx, line 77, replace:
const key = keyInput;

// With:
import { deriveEncryptionKey } from "@/app/lib/encryption";
const key = deriveEncryptionKey(keyInput, user.email);
```

This uses PBKDF2 for proper key derivation.

### **Testing Postman**
All backend routes still work! Test them as described earlier.

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Test the full flow:**
   - Sign in → Dashboard → Generator → Save to Vault → View/Edit/Delete

2. **Verify encryption:**
   - Check MongoDB to confirm encrypted storage

3. **Record demo video:**
   - Show signup/signin
   - Generate password
   - Save to vault
   - Search items
   - Edit/delete
   - Copy with auto-clear
   - Show encrypted data in MongoDB

4. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel (frontend + API routes)
   - MongoDB Atlas (database)
   - Environment variables for JWT_SECRET
