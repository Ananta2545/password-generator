# Vault Encryption Key Prompt Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

When entering the secure vault, **sometimes the encryption key prompt was not appearing**, causing confusion and potentially preventing access to vault items.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred due to a **state lifecycle mismatch**:

1. **`vaultAccessVerified`** - Component-level state (resets on every mount)
2. **`encryptionKey`** - VaultContext state (persists across navigation)

**Scenario that caused the bug:**
```
1. User visits vault → Access verified → Encryption key entered ✅
2. User navigates to dashboard (encryption key still in VaultContext)
3. User returns to vault
4. vaultAccessVerified = false (reset) → Access modal shows ✅
5. User verifies access → vaultAccessVerified = true
6. BUT encryptionKey still exists from step 1
7. Condition: if (!encryptionKey) → FALSE
8. Key prompt doesn't show ❌
9. User sees empty vault (can't decrypt without re-entering key)
```

## ✅ The Solution

Implemented **automatic encryption key cleanup** when user leaves the vault page for security and consistency.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated VaultContext Type Signature
**File:** `app/contexts/VaultContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
setEncryptionKey: (key: string) => void;
```

**After:**
```typescript
setEncryptionKey: (key: string | null) => void;
```
- Now allows setting encryption key to `null` for cleanup

#### 2. Added Cleanup on Component Unmount
**File:** `app/vault/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Clear encryption key when component unmounts (user leaves vault)
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Cleanup: clear encryption key when leaving vault for security
    setEncryptionKey(null);
  };
}, [setEncryptionKey]);
```

**What this does:**
- When user navigates away from vault (dashboard, generator, profile)
- The `return` function (cleanup) runs
- Encryption key is cleared from VaultContext
- Next visit requires re-entering the key

#### 3. Clarified useEffect Comments
**File:** `app/vault/page.tsx`

```typescript
// ✅ Show encryption key prompt after access verification OR if key is missing
useEffect(() => {
  if (mounted && user && vaultAccessVerified && !encryptionKey) {
    setShowKeyPrompt(true);
  }
}, [mounted, user, vaultAccessVerified, encryptionKey]);
```

## 🔒 Security Benefits

This fix actually **improves security**:

1. **Short-lived keys in memory** - Encryption key is cleared when leaving vault
2. **Re-verification required** - Each vault visit requires fresh key entry
3. **Prevents unauthorized access** - If someone walks up to an unlocked computer, they still need the encryption key
4. **Zero persistence** - Key never stored in localStorage or cookies

## 🎯 New Behavior (Fixed)

### Every Vault Visit Now:
```
1. User navigates to /vault
   ↓
2. Access verification modal appears
   - Enter password OR 2FA code
   ↓
3. Access granted (vaultAccessVerified = true)
   ↓
4. Encryption key prompt appears
   - Always shows because key was cleared on last exit
   ↓
5. User enters encryption key
   ↓
6. Vault items decrypted and displayed
   ↓
7. User navigates away (to dashboard, generator, etc.)
   ↓
8. Cleanup runs → Encryption key cleared
   ↓
9. Back to step 1 for next visit
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Buggy):
| Visit | Access Modal | Key Prompt | Result |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 1st   | ✅ Shows     | ✅ Shows   | ✅ Works |
| 2nd   | ✅ Shows     | ❌ Skipped | ❌ Empty vault |
| 3rd   | ✅ Shows     | ❌ Skipped | ❌ Empty vault |

### After (Fixed):
| Visit | Access Modal | Key Prompt | Result |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 1st   | ✅ Shows     | ✅ Shows   | ✅ Works |
| 2nd   | ✅ Shows     | ✅ Shows   | ✅ Works |
| 3rd   | ✅ Shows     | ✅ Shows   | ✅ Works |

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **First Visit:**
   - Go to `/vault`
   - Enter password/2FA code ✅
   - Enter encryption key ✅
   - See vault items ✅

2. **Leave Vault:**
   - Click "Back to Dashboard" or navigate to `/generator`
   - Encryption key is cleared in background

3. **Return to Vault:**
   - Go back to `/vault`
   - Access modal appears again ✅
   - Enter password/2FA code ✅
   - **Encryption key prompt appears** ✅ (THIS WAS THE BUG)
   - Enter encryption key ✅
   - See vault items ✅

4. **Repeat:**
   - Leave and return multiple times
   - Both prompts always appear consistently ✅

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Alternative Options Considered:

**Option 1: Keep encryption key in memory indefinitely**
- ❌ Security risk - key stays in memory even when not using vault
- ❌ Doesn't fix the bug completely

**Option 2: Store access verification in VaultContext**
- ❌ Would require access verification every vault visit anyway
- ❌ Adds complexity for no benefit

**Option 3: Store encryption key in localStorage**
- ❌ Major security risk - anyone with disk access can decrypt vault
- ❌ Violates zero-knowledge principle

**Option 4: Clear key on unmount (CHOSEN)** ✅
- ✅ Fixes the bug completely
- ✅ Improves security
- ✅ Consistent behavior every visit
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Follows security best practices

## 🎉 Result

Now the vault **always asks for the encryption key** every time you visit, ensuring:
- ✅ Consistent behavior
- ✅ No confusion
- ✅ Better security
- ✅ Reliable decryption

The encryption key is **short-lived and session-specific** to the vault page only!
